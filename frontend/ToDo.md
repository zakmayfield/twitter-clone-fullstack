- Add icons for tweet feed form

- tweets need to hold the username (which is implemented when creating the tweet) but also we need the tweet to reference the display name (eventually) to have a format like so 'Zak Mayfield @zaarNFT' || '{{display name}} @{{username}}

- Track which tweets the user has liked and display that like as a red heart
    - NEED TO add unlike functionality - this will need to determine if the tweet has already been liked by the user
